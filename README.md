# ibtracs-get-started
This repository contains a notebook to get you started with the [IBTrACS dataset](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/international-best-track-archive) using the [*clouddrift* library](https://clouddrift.org/).

These notebooks should be readily executable in a binder environment which can be launched by clicking the "launch binder" badge above ☝️. Alternatively, you can run locally the notebooks in a python environment containing the python libraries listed in the file environment.yml.

Feel free to contribute to this repo or raise an issue!
